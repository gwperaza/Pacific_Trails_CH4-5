<h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
<dl>
<dt>What is a yurt?</dt>
<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt has canvas walls, a wooden floor, a roof dome that can be opened, and a private deck.<dd>
<dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a gas fireplace, king-size bed with down quilt, comfy couch, dining table and chairs, mini-fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. Your luxury camping experience includes a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.<dd>
<dt>What should I bring?</dt>
<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!<dd>
